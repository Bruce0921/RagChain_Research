## 3. Report on FastAPI

### Introduction to FastAPI

FastAPI is a contemporary web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7 and later, notable for its high performance and ease of use. It leverages modern Python features such as asynchronous programming and type hints, offering a robust solution for developing APIs efficiently. Below are detailed insights into its key features:

#### Fast
FastAPI utilizes Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts. This architecture choice contributes to its high performance, making it significantly faster than traditional synchronous frameworks and capable of handling concurrent processes effectively. The asynchronous support is particularly advantageous for IO-bound and high-latency operations, allowing developers to handle multiple operations at once without blocking the server, thus increasing the throughput of applications.

#### Easy to Use
FastAPI was designed with the goal of simplicity and efficiency, allowing developers to create APIs with minimal setup. The framework encourages code reusability and is structured in a way that promotes clean and maintainable codebases. Newcomers find FastAPI easy to learn due to its straightforward syntax and because it builds upon familiar Python standards. Comprehensive documentation, which includes a large number of examples and interactive tutorials, facilitates a smooth learning curve and quick troubleshooting.

#### Automatic Documentation
One of the most celebrated features of FastAPI is its capability to automatically generate interactive API documentation using OpenAPI standards. This automated process ensures that the documentation is always up to date with the API's endpoints, parameters, and responses. The interactive environments provided by Swagger UI and ReDoc allow developers and stakeholders to visualize and interact with the API’s endpoints without writing any additional code. This not only aids in development and testing but also streamlines consumer integration and frontend development.

#### Type Hints
FastAPI's use of Python type hints is integral to its functionality. These type hints ensure that data is correctly typed upon input, which facilitates validation, serialization, and auto-completion in editors. This type enforcement leads to fewer runtime errors and a significant reduction in potential bugs, improving overall code quality. Additionally, type hints enable FastAPI to generate more accurate documentation and error messages, enhancing developer experience and API usability.

#### Dependency Injection
FastAPI features a powerful, easy-to-use dependency injection system that significantly enhances the framework’s flexibility and testability. This system allows developers to define reusable components (dependencies) that can be injected into path operations, reducing code duplication and increasing modularity. This approach is highly beneficial for creating scalable applications, as it simplifies managing shared resources like database connections, user authentication systems, and other services.

#### Security and Authentication
FastAPI provides extensive support to implement and manage authentication and security. It supports various authentication schemes out of the box, including OAuth2 with Password (and hashing), JWT tokens, and HTTP Basic Auth. This makes it easier to build secure APIs that protect resources and data effectively.

#### Extensibility
FastAPI is built to be extended. It allows developers to add custom dependencies, middleware, response handlers, and even swap out or integrate additional components like ORMs, task queues, and caching systems. This extensibility makes FastAPI adaptable to various project needs, from simple microservices to complex applications.

### Core Components of FastAPI

#### APIRouter
`APIRouter` allows developers to organize and manage different parts of the API in a modular and scalable way. This feature helps in separating the routing logic into different files, making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain. Example usage:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/items/{item_id}", tags=["items"])
async def read_item(item_id: str):
    return {"name": "Foo", "item_id": item_id}

```

#### Pydantic Models
FastAPI uses Pydantic for data validation and settings management through Python type annotations. Pydantic models enforce type hints at runtime and provide user-friendly errors when data is invalid. Example definition:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str = None
    price: float
    tax: float = None

```

#### Dependency Injection
FastAPI's dependency injection system allows for reusable components and utilities to be easily integrated into your application's API endpoints. It can manage sophisticated user authentication and authorization schemes, database connections, and much more. Example of a simple dependency:
```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI

def get_query_token(token: str = Depends()):
    return token

@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(token: str = Depends(get_query_token)):
    return {"token": token}

```

## Building an API with FastAPI
Setting Up a New FastAPI Project
Start by setting up your project environment and installing necessary packages:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```
Create a new file, for example, main.py, and set up the first API endpoints:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}

```
#### Running the FastAPI Application
To run your FastAPI application, use Uvicorn as the ASGI server. Execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload  # The `--reload` flag enables auto-reloading for development.

```

### Integrating with Databases and External Services
FastAPI can be easily integrated with databases and external services. Here is a basic example of integrating with a SQL database using SQLAlchemy:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from . import crud, models, schemas
from .database import SessionLocal, engine

models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

app = FastAPI()

def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

@app.post("/users/", response_model=schemas.User)
def create_user(user: schemas.UserCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    return crud.create_user(db=db, user=user)

```

## Advanced Features of FastAPI

### Background Tasks
FastAPI allows you to define background tasks that are executed after a request has been returned. This is useful for operations like sending emails, processing data asynchronously, or making calls to external APIs without delaying the response to the client.

```python
from fastapi import BackgroundTasks, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

def write_log(message: str):
    with open("log.txt", "a") as file:
        file.write(message)

@app.post("/send-notification/")
async def send_notification(email: str, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    background_tasks.add_task(write_log, f"notification sent to {email}")
    return {"message": "Notification sent in the background"}

```

### Middleware
Middleware in FastAPI can be used to run some code before each request is processed and after each response is sent. This allows for tasks such as request logging, CORS handling, or security checks.
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from starlette.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

```

### WebSockets
FastAPI supports WebSockets out of the box, enabling real-time two-way communication between the client and server. This is ideal for features like chat applications or real-time updates.
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket

app = FastAPI()

@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    while True:
        data = await websocket.receive_text()
        await websocket.send_text(f"Message text was: {data}")

```

## Security Features
Authentication
FastAPI provides several tools to handle authentication securely and easily. Here is how you can implement OAuth2 with Password (and hashing), using JWT tokens for secure transmission of information between parties.
```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
from jose import JWTError, jwt
from passlib.context import CryptContext

```
