### Core Components of FastAPI

#### APIRouter
`APIRouter` allows developers to organize and manage different parts of the API in a modular and scalable way. This feature helps in separating the routing logic into different files, making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain. Example usage:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/items/{item_id}", tags=["items"])
async def read_item(item_id: str):
    return {"name": "Foo", "item_id": item_id}

```

#### Pydantic Models
FastAPI uses Pydantic for data validation and settings management through Python type annotations. Pydantic models enforce type hints at runtime and provide user-friendly errors when data is invalid. Example definition:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str = None
    price: float
    tax: float = None

```
Pydantic's integration allows for data validation through Python type annotations. This ensures that the data received and processed within the API adheres strictly to the defined schemas, providing automatic error handling and standardization of data formats.

#### Dependency Injection
FastAPI's dependency injection system allows for reusable components and utilities to be easily integrated into your application's API endpoints. It can manage sophisticated user authentication and authorization schemes, database connections, and much more. Example of a simple dependency:
```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI

def get_query_token(token: str = Depends()):
    return token

@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(token: str = Depends(get_query_token)):
    return {"token": token}

```
How to use dependency injection to manage database sessions throughout the lifecycle of a web request, ensuring efficient and safe handling of database connections.
```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from .database import SessionLocal

def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    items = db.query(models.Item).all()
    return items

```
## Building an API with FastAPI
Setting Up a New FastAPI Project
Start by setting up your project environment and installing necessary packages:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```
Create a new file, for example, main.py, and set up the first API endpoints:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}

```
#### Running the FastAPI Application
To run your FastAPI application, use Uvicorn as the ASGI server. Execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload  # The `--reload` flag enables auto-reloading for development.

```
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser to see your API in action.

### Integrating with Databases and External Services
FastAPI can be easily integrated with databases and external services. Here is a basic example of integrating with a SQL database using SQLAlchemy:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from . import crud, models, schemas
from .database import SessionLocal, engine

models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

app = FastAPI()

def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

@app.post("/users/", response_model=schemas.User)
def create_user(user: schemas.UserCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    return crud.create_user(db=db, user=user)

```

## Advanced Features of FastAPI

## Advanced Features of FastAPI

### Background Tasks

FastAPI's background tasks allow developers to execute functions asynchronously, which are invoked after a response has been sent to the client. This feature is crucial for performing operations that are necessary but not critical to the primary response of the server, such as processing data, sending emails, or updating records asynchronously.

#### Practical Application:
```python
@app.post("/send-email/")
async def send_email(email: str, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    background_tasks.add_task(send_email_to_user, email)
    return {"message": "Email is being sent in the background."}

```
This function takes user email as input and sends the email in the background, allowing the server to respond immediately without waiting for the email sending process to complete.

Background tasks in FastAPI allow operations like email notifications, external API calls, or data processing to run asynchronously without blocking server responses. This is crucial for maintaining the responsiveness of the application.

### Middleware
Middleware in FastAPI can be applied globally or on a per-application basis, allowing for operations that need to be handled on every request or response, such as Session Management, Security Enhancements, or Custom Analytics.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from starlette.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

```
Middleware can be used for a variety of cross-cutting concerns, such as session management, rate limiting, or server-side analytics.
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware

class CustomMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request, call_next):
        response = await call_next(request)
        response.headers['X-Custom-Header'] = 'Value'
        return response

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(CustomMiddleware)
```

### WebSockets
FastAPI provides full support for WebSockets, enabling real-time data flow between the client and the server. This is essential for applications that require real-time capabilities like chats, live notifications, or collaborative environments.
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket

app = FastAPI()

@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    while True:
        data = await websocket.receive_text()
        await websocket.send_text(f"Message text was: {data}")

```

## Security Features
Authentication
FastAPI provides several tools to handle authentication securely and easily. Here is how you can implement OAuth2 with Password (and hashing), using JWT tokens for secure transmission of information between parties.
```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
from jose import JWTError, jwt
from passlib.context import CryptContext

```
FastAPI's security utilities simplify the implementation of various authentication protocols, which can be customized extensively to fit the needs of any application.
```python

pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

def verify_password(plain_password, hashed_password):
    return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)

def get_user(db, username: str):
    if username in db:
        user_dict = db[username]
        return UserInDB(**user_dict)

def authenticate_user(fake_db, username: str, password: str):
    user = get_user(fake_db, username)
    if not user or not verify_password(password, user.hashed_password):
        return False
    return user

@app.post("/token")
async def login(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):
    user = authenticate_user(fake_fake_db, form_data.username, form_data.password)
    if not user:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Incorrect username or password",
            headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Bearer"},
        )
    access_token_expires = timedelta(minutes=ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES)
    access_token = create_access_token(
        data={"sub": user.username}, expires_delta=access_token_expires
    )
    return {"access_token": access_token, "token_type": "bearer"}

```
