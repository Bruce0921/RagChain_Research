# Week3 Report on Rag Chain and Potential Databases

## 1. Complete and Run the Document RAG Chain
- **Execution Details**: 
  - The RAG chain effectively synthesizes information from different AI models, demonstrating its capability to handle and compare diverse AI outputs effectively.
  - **Highlighted Outputs**: Key results from the outputs are highlighted to indicate areas requiring attention due to deprecated features or critical insights into the performance.

## 2. Replace Gemini with OpenAI and Compare Results
- **Performance Comparison**
  - **OpenAI Output**:
    ```json
    {
      "question": "What are the key points about Gemini and LLAMA models?",
      "result": "Gemini is a complex multimodal large-scale language model developed by Google. It is capable of understanding and integrating various data types, such as text, images, audio, and video. Gemini enhances Google's core products by providing more context-aware interactions and can undertake tasks that were previously challenging for AI. Its advanced analytics capabilities could potentially transform diagnosis and treatment in healthcare. Gemini represents the cutting edge of AI technology with several groundbreaking innovations.\n\nLLAMA, on the other hand, is a publicly accessible large-scale language model launched by Meta. It aims to democratize AI technology and promote broad accessibility and versatility. It is designed to handle a variety of complex tasks such as language understanding, translation, and content generation. LLAMA has been integrated into several consumer applications, enhancing user interaction with smart devices and social platforms. Code LLAMA is a specific version developed to meet the needs of specialized areas such as software development. LLAMA is one of the few open-source large models, which makes it easier to study, access, and apply to different fields with good scalability. Both models have sparked discussions about potential privacy breaches due to the use of personally identifiable information in their training datasets."

- **Differences Noted**:
  - **Detailing of Capabilities**: OpenAI provides a broader overview of Gemini's capabilities, particularly in healthcare, while Gemini's output emphasizes technical specifics.
  - **Performance and Integration**: Both models mention integration into consumer applications, but Gemini's output highlights the performance benefits from extensive training.
  - **Execution Time**:
    - OpenAI model: Approximately 20 seconds.
    - Gemini model: Approximately 8 seconds, indicating more efficient processing with Gemini's embedding model.

## 3. Research on Indexing, Splitting, Embedding, and Retrieval
- **Key Components**:
  - **Indexing**: Essential for quickly locating information within a large dataset.
  - **Splitting**: Helps manage large texts by breaking them into manageable chunks.
  - **Embedding**: Converts text into numerical vectors, capturing semantic meanings.
  - **Retrieval**: Retrieves the most relevant information based on query similarities.

## 4. Experiment with Different Embedding Models
- **Evaluation of Models**:
  - Models replaced: `model/embedding-001` with `embedding-002` and `embedding-003`.
  - Noted variations in response accuracy and handling of complex queries.

## 5. Database Integration with LLMs
- **Database Types**:
  - **Relational Databases**: Known for structured data management but may face challenges with horizontal scaling.
  - **NoSQL Databases**: Provide scalability and flexibility, ideal for handling large volumes of data.
  - **Graph Databases**: Manage complex relationships effectively.
  - **Document Stores**: Optimized for full-text search capabilities.
  - **In-Memory Databases**: Offer rapid data access but are limited by memory capacity.
  - **Time-Series Databases**: Optimized for handling time-stamped data efficiently.
